# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Majid Kumbhar

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Data Analyst**, **Aspiring ML Engineer**, and **Data Scientist** who loves turning real-world problems into solutions using data and code. Whether it's deploying a Streamlit app, scraping live data, I enjoy building tools that work and scale.

Currently, I’m on a journey to combine **data science**, and **web-based platforms** to craft useful and smart solutions.
